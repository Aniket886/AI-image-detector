   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## 🎯 How It Works

### Detection Algorithm

The AI detection engine uses multiple analysis techniques:

1. **Pixel Pattern Analysis**: Examines smoothness and uniformity patterns typical in AI-generated images
2. **Compression Artifact Detection**: Identifies JPEG compression patterns and quantization artifacts
3. **Color Distribution Analysis**: Analyzes color entropy and distribution patterns
4. **Edge Analysis**: Examines edge sharpness and gradient patterns
5. **Noise Pattern Detection**: Identifies artificial noise patterns vs. natural camera noise
6. **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Analyzes high/low frequency energy distribution
7. **Dimension Analysis**: Checks for common AI generation dimensions and aspect ratios
8. **Metadata Analysis**: Examines file properties and naming patterns

### Usage

1. **Upload Image**: Drag and drop or click to select an image file
2. **Analysis**: The system processes the image using advanced algorithms
3. **Results**: View detailed results with confidence scores and explanations
